# Project 2: Budget Planning Tool

## Overview
This project, developed as part of CS230: Software Engineering at the College of Wooster, focuses on creating a **Budget Planning Tool**. The tool is designed to help users track and manage their personal finances efficiently by allowing them to adjust income, set budgets, monitor expenses, and set financial goals.

## Features
- **Financial Goals**: Users can set financial goals such as saving for a purchase and track their progress toward these goals over time.
  
- **Projected Amounts**: The tool returns a projected amount based on user input for income and estimated spending, allowing users to forecast future financial situations.

- **Monthly/Weekly Expenses**: Users can break down their expenses by monthly or weekly timeframes to better understand their short- and long-term financial commitments. Users can categorize expenses into specific categories (e.g., food, rent, entertainment), helping them better understand their spending patterns.

- **Income Tracking (50-30-20 Rule)**:
  - 50% of income is allocated to needs and obligations (e.g., rent, utilities, groceries).
  - 30% is allocated to wants (e.g., entertainment, dining out).
  - 20% is allocated to savings or paying down debt.

- **Income Adjustment**: Users can easily track their income by manually adding or removing income based as income fluctuates. The user can see their current income each time they navigate to the main menu.

- **Emergency Fund**: Users can allocate to a separate emergency fund which can be at most 10% of the total income. The emergency fund deposit is then removed from the total income and placed separately in the emergency fund.
