# Project 2: Budget Planning Tool

## Overview
This project, developed as part of CS230: Software Engineering at the College of Wooster, focuses on creating a **Budget Planning Tool**. The tool is designed to help users track and manage their personal finances efficiently by allowing them to set budgets, monitor expenses, and visualize their spending habits.

## Features
- **Financial Goals**: Users can set financial goals, such as saving for a purchase or building an emergency fund, and track their progress toward these goals over time.
  
- **Projected Amounts**: The tool returns a projected amount based on user input for income and estimated spending, allowing users to forecast future financial situations.

- **Monthly/Weekly Expenses**: Users can break down their expenses by monthly or weekly timeframes to better understand their short- and long-term financial commitments.

- **User Input**: The tool accepts manual user input for income, expenses, and financial goals, making it customizable to individual financial circumstances.

- **Expense Categorization**: Users can categorize expenses into specific categories (e.g., food, rent, entertainment), helping them better understand their spending patterns.

- **50-30-20 Rule**:
  - 50% of income is allocated to needs and obligations (e.g., rent, utilities, groceries).
  - 30% is allocated to wants (e.g., entertainment, dining out).
  - 20% is allocated to savings or paying down debt.

- **Income Tracking (Bi-weekly/Weekly)**: Users can input their income bi-weekly or weekly to match their pay schedule and budget accordingly.

- **Budget (Monthly/Weekly/Daily)**: The tool allows users to set and adjust their budget on a monthly, weekly, or daily basis depending on their financial needs.

- **Bank Account-Based Budgeting**: The budget dynamically adjusts based on the percentage of money in the user's bank account. This feature ensures that users allocate the correct amount for each category based on real-time funds.

- **Comparison (Monthly/Weekly/Daily)**: Users can compare their spending and budgeting habits across different timeframes (monthly, weekly, or daily) to see how their financial behavior evolves over time.
